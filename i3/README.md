# i3
I'm not currently using i3 because I was having trouble finding a good workflow with it for my four-monitor setup.
I'd like to switch at some point, when either I can find the time to work through those quirks or I change the number of monitors I'm comfortable working with.
If/when I switch, this will be where i3 and i3status configuration go, as well as potentially i3-workscreen (tool for monitor handling) and 
feh (tool for setting background image, I only need it if I'm using i3 so it feels fitting to go here.
